# Day 01 - The Birth Of The Padawan

Day_01 is about implementing the search algorithim explained in the first 40minutes of the
[Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/pkYVOmU3MgA) video. This include implementation for linear search (simple search) algorithm to provide a brute-force solution to the problem at that point of the video.

It was implemented in Typescript with Deno as a Typescript runtime.
