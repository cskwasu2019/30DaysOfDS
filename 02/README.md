This is an implementation of merge sort algorithm (Divide and Conquer). It is mostly based on the merge sort algorithm implemented in this video [Algorithms and Data Structures - Full Course for Beginners from Treehouse](https://youtu.be/8hly31xKli0).

It was implemented in Typescript with Deno as a Typescript runtime.
